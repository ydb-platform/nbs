# Weekly VPNKit dev report for 2017-04-17 to 2017-04-23 (week 16)

This report covers weekly developments in the [moby/vpnkit], [mirage/ocaml-dns], [mirage/ocaml-hvsock], [djs55/ocaml-osx-dnssd] and [mirage/mirage-tcpip] repositories.

**TL;DR:** There were more DNS fixes around the handling of `localhost`, to address bugs
reported downstream by Docker for Mac users. This involved disabling the use of multicast DNS on macOS.

## PRs merged

- Do not attempt to look up `localhost.local` via mDNS ([moby/vpnkit#211]), and then entirely disable mDNS on macOS ([moby/vpnkit#213] [@djs55]).
- Rename the project from the `docker/` org to the `moby/` organisation ([moby/vpnkit#212] [@djs55]).

### PRs with activity

The [Lwt 3.0.0](https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt/releases/tag/3.0.0) release features several deprecated functions
and a rearrangement of the packages to be more consistent. Several of the VPNKit packages are being updated to
use the recommended interfaces and remain backwards compatible with older Lwt releases
([mirage/ocaml-dns#136] [mirage/mirage-tcpip#308] [@aantron] [@djs55] [@yomimono]).

The effort to add HTTP proxy support has stalled until upstream packages such as Cohttp integrated some
improvements ([moby/vpnkit#20] [@dave-tucker] [@avsm]).
Help welcome in this space; contact [@djs55] if interested!

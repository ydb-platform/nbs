# Logging

Terraform CLI, provider SDKs, and provider logic support a rich logging framework for [debugging](/terraform/plugin/debugging) in testing and production.

## Managing Log Output

Learn how to [use environment variables and other methods](/terraform/plugin/log/managing) to enable and filter logs.

## Writing Log Output

Learn how to [implement code in provider logic](/terraform/plugin/log/writing) to output logs.

## Filtering Log Output

Learn how to [implement code in provider logic](/terraform/plugin/log/filtering) to mask certain log messages and structured log fields or omit logs entirely.

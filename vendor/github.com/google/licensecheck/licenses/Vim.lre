(( VIM LICENSE ))??

   (( I) ))??
   There are no restrictions on distributing unmodified copies of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   except that they must include this license text. You can also distribute
   unmodified parts of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   , likewise unrestricted except that they must include this license text. You
   are also allowed to include executables that you made from the unmodified
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   sources, plus your own usage examples and Vim scripts.

   (( II) ))??
   It is allowed to distribute a modified (or extended) version of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   , including executables and/or source code, when the following four
   conditions are met:

      (( 1) ))??
      This license text must be included unmodified.

      (( 2) ))??
      The modified
      //** Vim **//
      __5__
      must be distributed in one of the following five ways:

         (( a) ))??
         If you make changes to
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         yourself, you must clearly describe in the distribution how to contact
         you. When the maintainer asks you (in any way) for a copy of the
         modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         you distributed, you must make your changes, including source code,
         available to the maintainer without fee. The maintainer reserves the
         right to include your changes in the official version of
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         . What the maintainer will do with your changes and under what license
         they will be distributed is negotiable. If there has been no
         negotiation then this license, or a later version, also applies to your
         changes. The current maintainer is Bram Moolenaar <Bram@vim.org>. If
         this changes it will be announced in appropriate places (most likely
         vim.sf.net, www.vim.org and/or comp.editors). When it is completely
         impossible to contact the maintainer, the obligation to send him your
         changes ceases. Once the maintainer has confirmed that he has received
         your changes they will not have to be sent again.

         (( b) ))??
         If you have received a modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         that was distributed as mentioned under a) you are allowed to further
         distribute it unmodified, as mentioned at I). If you make additional
         changes the text under a) applies to those changes.

         (( c) ))??
         Provide all the changes, including source code, with every copy of the
         modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         you distribute. This may be done in the form of a context diff. You can
         choose what license to use for new code you add. The changes and their
         license must not restrict others from making their own changes to the
         official version of
         //** Vim **//
         __5__

         (( d) ))??
         When you have a modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         which includes changes as mentioned under c), you can distribute it
         without the source code for the changes if the following three
         conditions are met:

            -
            The license that applies to the changes permits you to distribute
            the changes to the Vim maintainer without fee or restriction, and
            permits the Vim maintainer to include the changes in the official
            version of
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            without fee or restriction.

            -
            You keep the changes for at least three years after last
            distributing the corresponding modified
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            . When the maintainer or someone who you distributed the modified
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            to asks you (in any way) for the changes within this period, you
            must make them available to him.

            -
            You clearly describe in the distribution how to contact you. This
            contact information must remain valid for at least three years after
            last distributing the corresponding modified
            //** Vim **//
            __5__
            , or as long as possible.

         (( e) ))??
         When the GNU General Public License (GPL) applies to the changes, you
         can distribute the modified
         //** Vim **//
         __5__
         under the GNU GPL version 2 or any later version.

      (( 3) ))??
      A message must be added, at least in the output of the ":version" command
      and in the intro screen, such that the user of the modified
      //** Vim **//
      __5__
      is able to see that it was modified. When distributing as mentioned under
      2)e) adding the message is only required for as far as this does not
      conflict with the license used for the changes.

      (( 4) ))??
      The contact information as required under 2)a) and 2)d) must not be
      removed or changed, except that the person himself can make corrections.

   (( III) ))??
   If you distribute a modified version of
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   , you are encouraged to use the Vim license for your changes and make them
   available to the maintainer, including the source code. The preferred way to
   do this is by e-mail or by uploading the files to a server and e-mailing the
   URL. If the number of changes is small (e.g., a modified Makefile) e-mailing
   a context diff will do. The e-mail address to be used is
   <maintainer@vim.org>

   (( IV) ))??
   It is not allowed to remove this license from the distribution of the
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   sources, parts of it or from a modified version. You may use this license for
   previous
   //** Vim **//
   __5__
   releases instead of the license that they came with, at your option.

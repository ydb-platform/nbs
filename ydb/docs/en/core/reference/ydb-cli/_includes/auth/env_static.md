- If the value of the `YDB_USER` or `YDB_PASSWORD` environment variable is set, the username and password based authentication mode is used. The username is read from the `YDB_USER` variable. If it is not set, an error saying `User password was provided without user name` is returned. The password is read from the `YDB_PASSWORD` variable. If it is not set, then, depending on whether the `--no-password` command-line option is specified, either an empty password is used or a password is requested interactively.

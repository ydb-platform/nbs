// The wrapper over IStorage protects the underlying layers from executing
// overlapping zero or write requests.
// If the new request is received that intersects with an already executing one,
// it is postponed until the completion of the executing one.
// If the new request is completely covered by the executing one, then such a
// request can not be executed, but wait for completion and respond to both
// requests to the client. This is possible because inflight requests can be
// reordered, and we pretend that the #2 request was executed first, and was
// then completely rewritten by #1.
// Read requests are not affected in any way.
// Thread-safe.

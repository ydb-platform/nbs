Example queries:

1. Insert disk, range and time (UTC) for investigations.
```
INSERT into Ranges(DiskId, StartAt, EndAt, StartBlock, EndBlock)
       values ('sample-disk-id', '2025-10-14T06:45:00.000000Z', '2025-10-14T12:40:00.000000Z', 6708224, 6709247);
```

2. Find all requests and insert it into temp table
```
create table tmp1 as
SELECT
    r.id,
    printf('%s %.6d', datetime(r.AtUs / 1000000.0, 'unixepoch'), r.AtUs % 1000000) as At,
    r.AtUs,
    d.DiskId,
    rt.Request,
    r.StartBlock,
    r.EndBlock,
    r.DurationUs,
    r.StartBlock / 1024 as StartRangeIndex,
    r.EndBlock / 1024 as EndRangeIndex
from Requests as r
INNER join Disks as d on d.Id == r.DiskId
INNER JOIN RequestTypes as rt on rt.id = r.RequestTypeId
INNER join Ranges as rn
    on d.DiskId == rn.DiskId
    and (rn.StartBlock is null or rn.StartBlock <= r.EndBlock)
    and (rn.EndBlock is null or rn.EndBlock >= r.StartBlock)
    and (rn.StartAt is null or (julianday(rn.StartAt) - 2440587.5) * 86400000000 <= r.AtUs)
    and (rn.EndAt is null or (julianday(rn.EndAt) - 2440587.5) * 86400000000 >= r.AtUs)
```

3. Find overwritten blocks for range
```
select
    rn.DiskId,
    rn.StartBlock,
    bs.BlockIndx,
    min(f.At) as firstAt,
    max(f.At) as lastAt,
    count(f.id) as cnt
from Ranges as rn
inner join BlocksSequence as bs
    on rn.StartBlock <= rn.StartBlock + bs.BlockIndx
    and rn.EndBlock >= rn.StartBlock + bs.BlockIndx
left join tmp1 as f
    on (bs.BlockIndx + rn.StartBlock) >= f.StartBlock
    and (bs.BlockIndx + rn.StartBlock) <= f.EndBlock
    and f.Request == 'WriteBlocks'
group by bs.BlockIndx
order by bs.BlockIndx
```

4. Find overlapped reads and writes
```
select
	A.Id as ReadId,
	A.At as ReadAt,
	A.StartBlock as ReadStartBlock,
	A.EndBlock as ReadEndBlock,
	A.DurationUs as ReadDurationUs,
	B.Id as WriteId,
	B.At as WriteAt,
	B.StartBlock as WriteStartBlock,
	B.EndBlock as WriteEndBlock,
	B.DurationUs as WriteDurationUs
from tmp1 as A
inner join tmp1 as B
	on A.Request == "ReadBlocks"
	and B.Request == "WriteBlocks"
	and (A.AtUs + A.DurationUs >= B.AtUs and A.AtUs <= B.AtUs + B.DurationUs)
```

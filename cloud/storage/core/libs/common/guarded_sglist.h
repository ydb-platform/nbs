// The TGuardedSgList class allows you to safely terminate access to a memory
// object in a multithreaded environment.
// The owner of the memory, who wants to give access to it to one or more
// clients, must create a new TGuardedSgList, and pass to it a list of memory
// blocks (TSgList). The owner keeps this instance for himself, and gives other
// instances of TGuardedSgList created via Create() or CreateDepender() to
// clients. All these TGuardedSgList instances are linked to each other through
// a common GuardedObject or their hierarchy. The client that needs to access
// memory must access it through the Acquire() call. TGuard is returned to him,
// which guarantees that as long as TGuard exists, the memory will exist. The
// Acquire() call occurs without locks. After receiving the TGuard, it must be
// checked that the owner has not yet stopped accessing it and access has been
// obtained. This is done via operator bool(). Next, you can get a list of
// blocks from TGuard, it is not formally guaranteed that the list of
// blocks is not empty. When the owner of the memory wants to stop accessing it,
// he calls the Close() method from his TGuardedSgList instance. The Close()
// call blocks the thread in SpinLock until all clients finish access (delete
// their TGuards).

// From TGuardedSgList objects, you can build hierarchies by combining access to
// multiple TGuardedSgList or build chains via CreateDepender(). Under the hood,
// this is achieved through TUnionGuardedObject and TDependentGuardedObject.
// TUnionGuardedObject stores the TGuardedSgList vector, and
// TDependentGuardedObject stores only one. The Acquire() call on such objects
// will be successful if it is possible to set its own lock and the lock of the
// child IGuardedObject. For such objects, after Close(), access is
// terminated for objects located at the current level and lower in the
// hierarchy. This is the difference between the behavior of Create() and
// CreateDepender(). In the case of objects constructed via Create(), all
// instances are equivalent and calling Close() on any instance blocks access
// for everyone (there is no hierarchy). In the case of CreateDepender(), a
// hierarchy is created and access is blocked in the chain below.

// Usage example:
// auto sharedData = TString(8192, 'a');
// TSgList sglist = {{ sharedData.data(), 4096 }, { &sharedData[4096], 4096 }};
// TGuardedSgList guardedSgList(sglist);
//
// auto copy1 =  guardedSgList; // Simple copy
// auto copy2 =  guardedSgList.Create({sglist[1]}); // Access only to second 4K
// Pass copy1 & copy2 where you need
// {
//   if (auto guard = copy1.Acquire()) {
//     const TSgList& sgList = guard.Get();
//     Here you can safely access the sharedData
//   }
//   if (auto guard = copy2.Acquire()) {
//     const TSgList& sgList = guard.Get();
//     Here you can safely access the sharedData
//   }
// }
// guardedSgList.Close(); // Finish access to sharedData
// Here you can safely close sharedData, it is guaranteed that no one accesses
// it.

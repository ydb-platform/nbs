/**
 * @brief Manages read and write locks on arbitrary ranges, supporting
 * overlapping intervals.
 *
 * Provides mechanism to acquire and release read and write locks on specified
 * ranges. If a lock cannot be acquired immediately due to conflicts,
 * the request is queued and processed when possible. Supports concurrent read
 * and write locks on overlapping ranges, but read locks are exclusive with
 * write locks. Write locks are prioritized over read locks.
 *
 * @note All ranges are specified as [begin, end).
 *   Obtaining multiple locks over the same range is possible.
 *   Each lock is treated independently and requires the correspondent
 *   number of unlock operations.
 *
 * @section Usage
 * - Use LockRead() and LockWrite() to request locks.
 * - Provide a callback action that will be invoked when the lock is acquired.
 * - Use UnlockRead() and UnlockWrite() to release locks.
 * - The Empty() method checks if there are no active locks or pending requests.
